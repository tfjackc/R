geocomputional methods 

"spatial distribution
analysis, kernel density estimation, and spatial autocorrelation using local
Moran statistics (Moran, 1950), local indicators of spatial association (LISA)
(Anselin, 1995), and Getis-Ord (Gi Statistic) (Getis & Ord, 1992). All of these
methods were processed within the RStudio environment.

Using spatial distribution analysis, we plot the earthquake events for the last
120 years in Indonesia based on magnitude and depth. Spatial autocorrelation
measures the degree to which earthquake events are similar to nearby
earthquake events. Positive spatial autocorrelation is determined when similar
values tend to be closer together than dissimilar values. In the case of earthquake
data, earthquakes with similar characteristics tend to reside in similar
neighbourhoods due to various reasons, including depth, magnitude, or tsunami
events generated from the earthquake. In this study, we evaluate the spatial
autocorrelation of variable depth and magnitude to tsunami events.
Several packages need to be installed and activated when using geostatistical
methods within RStudio. For instance, we need to install and activate the
"raster" and "adehabitatHR" for kernel density estimation. Furthermore, we
need to install and activate the "deldir" and "spdep" packages for spatial
autocorrelation analysis."

questions to ask about r apps and earthquake data, what are we trying to solve?

Visualizing seismic data: R Shiny apps can be used to visualize seismic data in a variety of ways, including maps, graphs, and charts. This can help researchers to identify patterns and trends in the data, and to communicate their findings to others.
Analyzing seismic data: R Shiny apps can be used to analyze seismic data using a variety of statistical methods. This can help researchers to identify the causes of earthquakes, to predict the likelihood of future earthquakes, and to develop mitigation strategies.
